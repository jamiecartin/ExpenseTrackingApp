## Roadmap

We're constantly working to improve ExpenseExpress and add new features. Here are some of the things we have planned for the future:

- More customization options: We want to give users even more control over their expenses, with more tools for individualized tracking.
- Improved mobile support: While ExpenseExpress works on mobile devices, we're looking to optimize the experience for smaller screens.
- Collaboration tools: We're exploring ways to make collaboration even easier, with features like real-time chat and video conferencing to manage finances as a family.
- Integration with other apps: We want to make it easy to use ExpenseExpress with other tools you already use, like Mint or Credit Karma.
